# Tutorial 1.1

You are asked to design a horizontal axis wind turbine with 2 MW rated output.

By showing detailed design calculation, provide the following design parameters for the wind turbines:

1. Minimum rotor diameter
1. Minimum rotor hub height

State all your assumption.

## Solution (Write your solution here).

Assume V= 11m/s, Cp=1.225, rho=1.225kg/m3
2x10x6 W = 0.5x(16/27)x1.225x(11x11x11)xA
A=4139.8979
R=rootA / pi
R= 36.3
Ans: Min rotor diameter = 36.3m

Assuming Zo = 1, h =10m, V = 10m/s, Vh=20m/s
20=10x(ln(h/1)/ln(10/1))
h=100m 
Ans: Min rotor hub height = 100m.
